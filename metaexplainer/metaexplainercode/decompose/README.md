Decompose takes a user question and finds explanation types that could address it.

The explanation types are identified by a combination of the operations below:
- Identify which explanations would match the question heads
- What are the types of entities being asked about in the question? -> columns, samples, feature labels, literature, etc. (yet to be implemented)
