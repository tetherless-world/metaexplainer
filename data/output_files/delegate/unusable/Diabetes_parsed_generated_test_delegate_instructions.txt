Question : Why emphasize the Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.25 in predicting Diabetes for a 45-year-old female with a BMI of 26, rather than the same Diabetes Pedigree Function in a 70-year-old male with a BMI of 18?
Machine interpretation : Emphasize(DiabetesPedigreeFunction, 0.25, Female, 45, BMI = 26) over Emphasize(DiabetesPedigreeFunction, 0.25, Male, 70, BMI = 18)

Question : How would the Diabetes prediction change if the patient had a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.3 instead of 0.1?
Machine interpretation : If DiabetesPedigreeFunction(patient, 0.3) and DiabetesPedigreeFunction(patient, 0.1), how would the Diabetes prediction change?
Feature groups : {'DiabetesPedigreeFunction': '0.3'}

Explanation type : Counterfactual
---------
Question : Why consider a high BMI of 28 as a significant factor for predicting Diabetes in a 60-year-old male with a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.2, rather than focusing on a low BMI of 20 in a 30-year-old female with a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.1?
Machine interpretation : Predict(BMI = 28, Diabetes = high, Age = 60, Sex = Male, DPF = 0.2) over Predict(BMI = 20, Diabetes = low, Age = 30, Sex = Female, DPF = 0.1)
Action : Predict
Feature groups : {'BMI': '28', 'Diabetes': 'high', 'Age': '60', 'Sex': 'Male', 'DPF': '0.2'}
Feature groups : {'BMI': '20', 'Diabetes': 'low', 'Age': '30', 'Sex': 'Female', 'DPF': '0.1'}
Explanation type : Reason Explanation

Question : What broader information about the current situation prompted the suggestion of a high likelihood of Diabetes for a 40-year-old female with a BMI of 25 and a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.3?
Machine interpretation : Prompted(Suggestion(Diabetes, 40, Female, 25, BMI, 0.3, Diabetes Pedigree Function))
Action : Suggestion
Feature groups : {'Diabetes': '40', 'Female': '25', 'Diabetes Pedigree Function': ''}
