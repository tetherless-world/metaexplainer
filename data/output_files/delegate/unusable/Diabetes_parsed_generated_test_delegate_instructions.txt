Question : Why consider a high BMI of 28 as a significant factor for predicting Diabetes in a 60-year-old male with a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.2, rather than focusing on a low BMI of 20 in a 30-year-old female with a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.1?
Machine interpretation : Predict(BMI = 28, Age = 60, Sex = Male, DPF = 0.2) over Predict(BMI = 20, Age = 30, Sex = Female, DPF = 0.1)
Action : Predict

Action : Diabetes
Action : Predict
Feature groups : {'Diabetes': ''}
Feature groups : {'Age': '55', 'Sex': 'Female', 'BMI': '19', 'Diabetes Pedigree Function': '0.15'}
Feature groups : {'() and not  (Age': '55', 'Sex': 'Female', 'BMI': '19', 'Pedigree Function': '0.15)'}
