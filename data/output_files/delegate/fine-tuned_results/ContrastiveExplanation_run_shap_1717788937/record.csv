Question,"Why consider a high BMI of 28 as a significant factor for predicting Diabetes in a 60-year-old male with a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.2, rather than focusing on a low BMI of 20 in a 30-year-old female with a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.1?"
Machine interpretation,"Predict(Diabetes, Age = 60, Sex = Male, BMI = 28, DPF = 0.2) > Predict(Diabetes, Age = 30, Sex = Female, BMI = 20, DPF = 0.1)"
