Feature groups : {'Sex': ''}
Feature groups : {'BMI': ''}
Explanation type : Contrastive Explanation
---------
Question : If the patient was male instead of female, would the likelihood of having Diabetes be affected?
Machine interpretation : If Male(patient) instead of Female(patient), would Diabetes Likelihood change?
Action : Male
Action : Female
Feature groups : {'patient': ''}
Feature groups : {'patient': ''}
Explanation type : Counterfactual Explanation
---------
Question : What role does gender play in the feature selection process for predicting Diabetes?
Machine interpretation : 
Feature groups : {'Pregnancies': ''}
Explanation type : Contrastive Explanation
---------
Question : What broader information about the current situation prompted the suggestion of this recommendation for a 30-year-old male with a BMI of 18 and a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.3?
Machine interpretation : RecommendationPrompt(BMI = 18, DPF = 0.3, Age = 30)
Action : RecommendationPrompt
Feature groups : {'BMI': '18', 'DPF': '0.3', 'Age': '30'}
Explanation type : Contextual Explanation
---------
Question : What led the model to predict no Diabetes for a 50-year-old male with a BMI of 22 and a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.15?
Machine interpretation : Predict(Diabetes, Age = 50, Sex = Male, BMI = 22, DP_F = 0.15) -> no Diabetes
Action : Predict
Feature groups : {'Diabetes': '', 'Age': '50', 'Sex': 'Male', 'BMI': '22', 'DP_F': '0.15'}
Explanation type : Rationale Explanation
---------
Question : Why consider a patient's BMI range of 18-22 for Diabetes prediction rather than 25-30?
Machine interpretation : Consider =  Action
Feature groups : {'Insulin': ''}
Explanation type : Contrastive Explanation
---------
Question : How did the model justify predicting Diabetes for a 45-year-old male with a BMI of 27 and a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.2?
Machine interpretation : 
Feature groups : {'BMI': ''}
Explanation type : Rationale Explanation
---------
Question : Why prioritize the Diabetes Pedigree Function value of 0.1 in predicting Diabetes over 0.2?
Machine interpretation : = Predict(Diabetes) given Diabetes Pedigree Function = 0.1 and Diabetes Pedigree Function = 0.2
Action : Predict
Feature groups : {'Diabetes': ''}
Explanation type : Contrastive Explanation
---------
Question : If the patient was male instead of female, would the risk of Diabetes prediction increase?
Machine interpretation : 
Feature groups : {'Pregnancies': ''}
Explanation type : Contrastive Explanation
---------
Question : What is the impact of age and BMI combined on the Diabetes prediction outcome?
Machine interpretation : 
Feature groups : {'BMI': ''}
Explanation type : Contrastive Explanation
---------
Question : What influenced the model to predict that a 65-year-old male with a BMI of 18 and a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.15 does not have Diabetes?
Machine interpretation : Predict(Diabetes, Age = 65, Sex = Male, BMI = 18, DiabetesPedigreeFunction = 0.15) -> no Diabetes
Action : Predict
Feature groups : {'Diabetes': '', 'Age': '65', 'Sex': 'Male', 'BMI': '18', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction': '0.15'}
Explanation type : Counterfactual Explanation
