---------
Question : If the patient was male instead of female, would the likelihood of having Diabetes be affected?

Question : What led the model to predict no Diabetes for a 50-year-old male with a BMI of 22 and a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.15?
Machine interpretation : Predict(Diabetes, Male, 50, BMI = 22, DPF = 0.15) -> no Diabetes
Action : Predict
