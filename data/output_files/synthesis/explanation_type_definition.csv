,Explanation type,Definition
0,Case Based Explanation,"Provides solutions that are based on actual prior cases that can be presented to the user to provide compelling support for the system’s conclusions, and may involve analogical reasoning, relying on similarities between features of the case and of the current situation."
1,Contrastive Explanation,"Answers the question “Why this output instead of that output,” making a contrast between the given output and the facts that led to it (inputs and other considerations),  and an alternate output of interest and the foil (facts that would have led to it)."
2,Data Explanation,"focuses on what the data is and how it has been used in a particular decision, as well as what data and how it has been used to train and test the ML model. This type of explanation can help users understand the influence of data on decisions."
3,Rationale Explanation,"This type of explanation is about the “why” of an ML decision and provides reasons that led to a decision, and is delivered in an accessible and understandable way, especially for lay users. If the ML decision was not what users expected, this type of explanation allows users to assess whether they believe the reasoning of the decision is flawed. While, if so, the explanation supports them to formulate reasonable arguments for why they think this is the case."
4,Contextual Explanation,"Refers to information about items other than the explicit inputs and output, such as information about the user, situation, and broader environment that affected the computation."
5,Counterfactual Explanation,Addresses the question of what solutions would have been obtained with a different set of inputs than those used.
