These profiles often utilize specific BMI ranges to identify patients at higher risk of developing Diabetes. In order to create these profiles, the distribution of BMI values has been carefully analyzed and BMI ranges have been determined where the likelihood of Diabetes onset is significantly higher.\n\nA BMI range of 25 to 30 is typically associated with a high risk of Diabetes development, while a BMI below 18 is associated with a lower risk. If the patient's BMI is within the high-risk range, a high likelihood of Diabetes exists. If the BMI is below 18, the likelihood is lower. If the BMI is between 18 and 25, the likelihood of Diabetes prediction depends on other factors.\n\nIn summary, the distribution of BMI values has been leveraged to create risk profiles for Diabetes prediction, with BMI ranges of 25 to "
