The patient is 60 years old, which is above the average age for Diabetes prediction. The patient is also male, which is a factor that tends to decrease the likelihood of Diabetes. The BMI of 28 is also below the threshold for high BMI, which is a factor that tends to increase the likelihood of Diabetes. Finally, the Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.1 is low, which indicates that the patient has a low genetic predisposition to Diabetes. \nThe combination of these factors has led the model to predict that the patient does not have Diabetes. \n\n###  Rationale:\nThe rationale for this prediction is that the patient's characteristics do not align with the typical patterns associated with Diabetes prediction. The model has learned to identify these patterns and has applied them to this patient's case to make a prediction. \n\n###  Explanation type:\nThe explanation type for this prediction is Rationale"
