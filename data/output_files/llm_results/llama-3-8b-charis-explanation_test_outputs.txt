These features suggest that the patient is less likely to have Diabetes. However, the model also considered the patient's age and sex, which are indicative of a higher risk of Diabetes. The model's prediction of Diabetes for this patient is therefore justified by the consideration of multiple relevant features.\n \n###  Rationale Explanation:\n  The model used a combination of features to justify the prediction of Diabetes for the patient. The feature selection process identified the patient's age, sex, BMI, and Diabetes Pedigree Function as relevant for the prediction. The model's use of these features to justify the prediction is in line with the patient's actual risk of having Diabetes.\n \n###  Explanation type:\n  Rationale Explanation \n \n\n###  Target variable:\n  Diabetes prediction \n\n###  Explanation:\n  The model used a combination of features to justify the prediction of Diabetes for the patient.
