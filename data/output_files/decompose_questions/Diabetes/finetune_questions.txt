Machine Interpretation :  How did the model conclude that a patient with ( age=55, sex=Male, BMI=18, Diabetes Pedigree Function=0.25, Diabetes = high ) is predicted to have Diabetes with high likelihood?
Explanation Type :  Rationale Explanation
Target Variable :  Diabetes prediction = high

Question :  What features led the model to predict that a 65-year-old female with a BMI of 26 and a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.2 has Diabetes?
Machine Interpretation :  What are the key features that influenced the model to classify a patient with ( age=65, sex=Female, BMI=26, Diabetes Pedigree Function=0.2, Diabetes = high) as having Diabetes with high likelihood?
Explanation Type :  Rationale Explanation
Target Variable :  Diabetes prediction = high

Question :  Why did the model determine that a 30-year-old male with a BMI of 24 and a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.1 does not have Diabetes?
Machine Interpretation :  Why did the model classify a patient with ( age=30, sex=Male, BMI=24, Diabetes Pedigree Function=0.1, Diabetes = low) as not having Diabetes with low likelihood?
Explanation Type :  Rationale Explanation
Target Variable :  Diabetes prediction = low

Question :  How did the model decide that a 45-year-old female with a BMI of 28 and a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.3 is likely to have Diabetes?
Machine Interpretation :  How did the model determine that a patient with ( age=45, sex=Female, BMI=28, Diabetes Pedigree Function=0.3, Diabetes = high) is predicted to have Diabetes with high likelihood?
Explanation Type :  Rationale Explanation
Target Variable :  Diabetes prediction = high

Question :  What factors contributed to the model predicting that a 55-year-old male with a BMI of 20 and a Diabetes Pedigree Function of 0.2 does not have Diabetes?
Machine Interpretation :  What influenced the model's decision to classify a patient with ( age=55, sex=Male, BMI=20, Diabetes Pedigree Function=0.2, Diabetes = low) as not having Diabetes with low likelihood?
Explanation Type :  Rationale Explanation
Target Variable :  Diabetes prediction = low
