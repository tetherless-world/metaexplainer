  Pretend that you are a machine who is trying to understand what action to take on a question.
  Your job is to what type of explanation to provide and how to provide that explanation.
  If there exists methods to produce the explanation, you must detect what the methods are.
  If the author of the question expresses an explicit preference for a particular explanation type, you must detect it.
  You will be given a question and its interpretation for each task. 
  The interpretation will include the machine interpretation - which is a predicate logic translation of the question, action in the question, explanation type that can address a question of this type, target variable in the question which is being enquired about and a likelihood of that variable.
  The options will be denoted by Question:, Machine interpretation:,  Action:, 
   Explanation type:  and  Target variable: .
  You MUST respond with a valid Machine interpretation, action, explanation type and target variable.
